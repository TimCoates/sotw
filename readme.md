## Synopsis

This is an Android App, for showing the current standing in the Segment Of The Week (SOTW) competition.

## Code Example

It uses a series of web services running in AWS, to provide the data, from Strava.

## Motivation

People competing in SOTW need to know how they're doing, and be motivated when someone else has a bash.

## Installation

The APK file in the project root should just install on Android devices.
